“Attention Is All You Need” is a landmark research paper published by Vaswani et al. in 2017.
The paper introduced the Transformer architecture for sequence-to-sequence learning.
It eliminated the use of recurrent (RNN) and convolutional networks.
The model relies entirely on attention mechanisms to process input data.
Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence.
The Transformer processes data in parallel, improving training speed.
It uses multi-head attention to capture different relationships in data simultaneously.
Positional encoding is used to retain word order information.
The architecture consists of encoder and decoder blocks.
Each block contains attention layers and feed-forward neural networks.
Layer normalization and residual connections improve training stability.
The model significantly outperformed previous models in machine translation tasks.
It reduced training time while achieving better accuracy.
The Transformer became the foundation for modern models like BERT, GPT, and T5.
The paper revolutionized natural language processing and deep learning research.
